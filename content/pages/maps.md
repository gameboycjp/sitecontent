# Maps

Here is the list of various game maps I've done.

## Median

Median is a map originally created for the game [NeosVR](https://neosvr.com); based on the PC demo of the same name by Ümlaüt Design.  
All assets presents were made from scratch only using Open-Source software.

Software used:
- Blender (terrain modeling)
- GIMP (textures)
