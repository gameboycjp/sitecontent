# AS211696

This page is for stuff about my personal AS, [AS211696](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/211696). The following prefixes are announced:

 - 2001:67c:2724::/48
 - 2a0e:8f02:f01f::/48
 - 2a12:4946:9900::/40
 - 88.218.40.0/24

All prefixes are valid ROA and IRR and are announced using the [BIRD Internet Router Daemon](https://bird.network.cz/).

Current upstreams are (updated hourly):

{{< bgpUpstreams >}}

The <span class="il">2a0e:8f02:f01f::/48</span> prefix is now deprecated and used for the internal infrastructure and was replaced with <span class="il">2001:67c:2724::/48</span> (for public servers & services; for instance this website).

The <span class="il">2a12:4946:9900::/40</span> prefix is used for user tunnels (registrations & requests closed at the moment).

{{< attention "Legacy IP prefixes are currently awaiting big changes" >}}

The legacy prefix <span class="il">88.218.40.0/24</span> is rented (and really expensive) and will stop being announced on <span class="il">2024/01/31 12:00:00+03:00</span> due to the cost of and work of maintaining legacy resources. The only worry for this big migration is concerning federating services such as email, Matrix and XMPP where IPv6 support varies widely from server to server.
