# AS211696

This page serves as an archive for something I did for some years.  
This project was originally started as a way for me to learn even more about networking, and it served its purpose.

Thanks to everybody that helped me and made that experience worthwhile!

## Archive content

This page is for stuff about my personal AS, [AS211696](https://www.peeringdb.com/asn/211696). The following prefixes are announced:
