# Stickers

I got plenty of stickers on my laptops and other devices.  
This page serves to show those.

## Laptop 1- ThinkPad x200

This laptop is my portable daily driver.  
You can read more about it in [the dedicated blog post](/blog/2023/03/10/using-an-old-laptop/).

## Laptop 2 - MacBook Pro M1

This laptop is my MacBook Pro M1, described in a handful of blog posts talking about testing it and how it was after three months of use.

This is my work laptop and runs ArchLinux. Really good laptop.
