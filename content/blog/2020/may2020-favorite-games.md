In the current times, I think everyone agrees to say the lockdown is boring.  
This is why I compiled a small list of my favorite games and why I love them.  

 1. [Etterna Online](https://etternaonline.com/): this game is a fork of the rhythm game [Stepmania](https://www.stepmania.com) with the ability to download song packs directly in-game and rank servers.  
If like me you are a fan of rhythm games, this one is perfect as it is also open-source.  

 2. [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/): TIS-100 is a game where you need to program in a special assembly language.  
At the start, you are given a PDF containing the documentation of the language and here you are, you are ready to begin.  
With over [230 hours played](https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaebeojkkoch-i), I can surely say it is one of my favorite games.  

 3. [Starbound](https://playstarbound.com): Starbound is my most played game on Steam (more than 1500 in total) and one of my all-time favorite. This spatial exploration Terraria-like never ceases to surprise me with big updates or even with small details.  
You click on an arcade booth? You can now play the [Windows "Maze" screensaver](https://invidio.us/watch?v=oRL5durPleI).  
Since some updates, there is also tons of additional missions and content to get, this game will never be  truely finished.  

 4. [GZdoom](https://zdoom.org/downloads): the first Doom but with mods, custom maps and more. Anyone for a small game of [Desert Bus](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/102914-revenant-bus-a-doom-2-simulation-map/)? :^)  

I hope you guys like these games as well, if you want to share experiences or suggest something to enhance the article, don't hesitate to contact me.  
I'll see you next time!
