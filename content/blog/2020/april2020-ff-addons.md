As you may know, I am a Mozilla Firefox user.  
Here is the addons I am currently using to enhance my experience on the web:

- [Ublock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) a basic ad-blocker that just works
- [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/?src=search) a more advanced tool made to block cookies, frames and more
- [SponsorBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/) an extension that automatically skips hardcoded ads in Youtube/Invidous videos
- [Imagus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imagus/) enlarge images with a simple mouse hover
- [FoxyProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) used to add rules for Onion URLs or I2P
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/) everything is in the name
- [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) custom user JS scripts
- [ClearURLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/clearurls/) used to clear urls from tracking metadata
- [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) used for my self-hosted vault

That's all for the addons I'm using currently.  
Next list next year!
