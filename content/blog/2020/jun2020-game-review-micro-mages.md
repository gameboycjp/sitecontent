**Micro Mages** is a game I've heard about before. In fact, I saw the [youtube video of the creators of the game explaining how they made it](https://invidio.us/watch?v=ZWQ0591PAxM) and was interested in playing it since it runs on a NES.  
This month, Itch.io launched the [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) on which I gave some money and Micro Mages was (and still is) part of the package.  

Let's begin with the actual test shall we?  
To start, Micro Mages does not have a native PC version and the bundled executable is just an emulator which is crazy for a game that recent if you ask me.  
What about the game itself?  
First of all, it looks nice. The sprites are simple but just what is enough to look really good, we can clearly see lots of efforts went into the spritework.
The level design itself is somewhat simple and fun to play, the objectives are clear and the game itself, challenging enough.  
Haven't played the multiplayer version for now but I think It will be fun with some friends.  

Final rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
