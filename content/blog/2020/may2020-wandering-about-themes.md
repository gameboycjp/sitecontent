Greetings everyone.  
Today, I want to talk about my experience with themes and why I chose to keep the current one.  

Few days ago, I had an idea in mind: change the theme of my website, but why?  

As you may know (or not), I don't like when everything is smooth and too regular, I mean, yes, I like when all my projects works at the first try and without any flaws but sometimes, I dislike the routine of all things.  
For instance, if I'm trying to learn something, I'll try for few days and then, loose interest for that same thing I wanted to learn, this is especially present when trying to learn something academically.  
You migh say I am lazy and you are probably right, or maybe routine isn't a thing for me.  

Luckily, working in new technologies doesn't seems (for the moment) any kind of routine, I am always learning things, changing my ways of doing and most of all, discovering every day.  
The fun thing about computers is the only thing bad you can do is erase a file or maybe corrupt the hard drive and since this is my field, I am confident enough to re-install everything and start from scratch again.  
Some people like to have some sort of stability or assurance that their computer will not explode on their face or just delete random files and I fully understand the reasons but it's simply not for me.  

To get back to the themes, why did I had the idea to change the current theme, which is fine by the way?  
Well, it is because of the reasons described earlier but also because I wanted to see how my website looks with another theme.  
After few attemps, and the *horror* of the git submodules, I eventually gave up.  
Why?  
Because as said, I am lazy sometimes and I don't wanted to fight with a repository.  
This might sound anticlimactic but that's the whole story.  

I hope you liked it and if you do, be sure to add the RSS feed of the blog so you will never miss any future blog posts.  
I'll see you next time!
