In 2019, I re-worked on my website to make one easier to manage using [Docker](https://docker.com), simple XHTML but mostly, splitting the blog to another domain.  
The only problem is: my server is a rented one and not the most powerful in the world so it will not last in time.

This is why I decided to make a new website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a framework build in [Go](https://golang.org).  
As all of the content on hugo websites are written in Markdown, it is very easy to maintain a website, even if the blog in embedded into it (like as now).  
Hugo has also a really easy integration of the Gitlab CI and Gitlab Pages to make it easier to deploy.

Expect blog posts to be more frequent. If you don't want to miss a thing, you can [subscribe via RSS](/index.xml).  
I'll see you in the next post. ðŸ‘‹
