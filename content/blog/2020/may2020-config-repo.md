Greetings.  
I just did something I wanted to do since some time: compile all my personal configs & scripts and ship them into a repo and here it is, [the repository of my own configs](https://github.com/Jaekr/own-scripts) (still in WIP).  
I'll slowly add all my scripts and the ones I find (crediting the author of course).  

Why did I do that?  
Well this is simple: I love to browse dotfiles repositories and find useless, so essentials, scripts on the internet, I have the feeling of "it might come in handy some day" (spoiler alert, it doesn't for the most part).  
This is why I created this repo, to compile all the scripts that are actually useful for me. Nothing else, I swear.  

Be sure to check the repo out and if you want, ask for a config you'd like to see (if I forgot one).  
Don't worry, you can takes theses scripts, modify them to fit your needs, share them or just use them the vanilla way.  

If you like my content, be sure to subscribe with the RSS feed of the blog so you don't miss any future entries.  
Some updates about this repo will be discussed here and maybe some configs in particular.  
I'll see you next time!
