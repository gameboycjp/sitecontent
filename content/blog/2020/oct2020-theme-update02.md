This is just a small post to say that I've updated the blog to a new theme that is both lighter and nicer than the old one.

As it is now, the blog does not utilizes Tailwind CSS anymore.

As a reminder, you can see the code of the theme by [clicking here](https://forge.tedomum.net/jae/enhanced).

Stay tuned for the next blog post via [RSS](https://jae.moe/blog/index.xml)!

I'll see you next time!
