As you may have seen yesterday, the services were offline for a period of 30 minutes following a maintenance of the server that added 16Gt of RAM, bringing it to a whooping 64Gt of RAM.

The next interruption will be announced when it will be time to upgrade the storage (which will probably be done some time during next month).

I'll see you next time!
