Greetings everyone!

As you may know if you are in channels sourrounding me, I finally stepped up in my self-hosting quest and got a home server to host all my stuff myself.

In the past week, as I got this new machine, I started moving my different services and sites on it (which is fully done now), so sorry if it was a bit laggy or just completely down for some time.

Now, the next goal is to get the hardware required to make mass storage possible, which I hope will be possible over the next months.

In other news, [I have a small Matrix room to talk about this blog](https://matrix.to/#/#home:jae.fi?via=jae.fi), so don't hesitate to join!

I'll see you next time!
