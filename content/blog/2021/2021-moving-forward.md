Greetings, small post today, nonetheless important.

> TL;DR: I'm transgender, please use the she/her pronouns with me now.

Those whom know me AFK (away from keyboard) might have noticed some changes over the past year or so (since April 2021 to be more precise) and the reason for this might come as a surprise to some of you.

On April 28th 2021, I started a transition, but it was only the first step of a long journey.

Now that I moved on my own, settled in a place I can call home, I feel much more comfortable coming forward like this. Finally, getting a job at the start of the year acted like a catalyst through which I started to feel better.

Since I moved, I started enjoying small things again such as walking around where I live, eating a good homemade meal or just listening some music instead of surviving for the sake of surviving.

In the past few months, I met countless people which are now good friends, support me in any situation, and they are proving to me that improvement is possible.

## My name is Jae and I am a woman.

So now the time to thank people for support:

 - Thanks to the French non-profit Fransgenre for supporting me and helping me to hold all those years.
 - Thanks to all the people who have been here physically (or not) to support me.

And most importantly, thanks to you for reading this far.

If you have questions after reading this, my direct messages are open on Matrix (@me:jae.fi) or any other platform (you'll already know how to contact me there then).

The journey is long, but the path is free, ‚Å£I'll see you next time!
