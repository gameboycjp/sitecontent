Hey everyone, I've changed the blog engine again. Why? Well, frankly, I don't even know myself.

Maybe with the recent changes in my life (as you may know, I moved to Finland) I needed to change some things around here.

I was browsing the awesome-selfhosted list on GitHub when I saw the blog engine named “Ghost” which looked way more refined than anything I could ever do with Hugo or Spip so let's give it a spin!

Furthermore, on a minor note, I changed the server, and I'll be starting to migrate services such as the Gemini websites soon to the new hardware! Of course, you will be notified when it happens.

P.S: the sign-up feature of this website is broken, do not try to use it. Also, for some reason, it wants to make people pay.

P.S again: removed it completely :)
