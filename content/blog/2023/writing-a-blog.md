Hey there, small post today!  
Over the years, I've noticed how hard it can be to get on the IDE and write a new blog article.  
As you may have noticed, most of mine are about some thing I made or tested over time, mostly on the technical side.  
With that in mind, finding new subjects to write about that I connect with has been getting pretty hard, lots of drafts for not much published (for instance, at the moment of writing this, I got 6 drafts actively being worked on, probably only one or two will be published at the end).

Now, let's try something "new".  
Some blog posts were really outside of the usual, things like "[My name has finally been changed](/blog/2022/09/30/my-name-has-finally-been-changed/)" or "[Jae's kitchen: making crunchy peanuts](/blog/2022/03/21/jaes-kitchen-making-crunchy-peanuts/)", I want to try to post about more _petty_ things that are not only technical and then see how it goes.

A long time ago, I even tried writing some [game reviews](/blog/2020/06/13/game-review-micro-mages/) so why not try to bring the format back?

Let's see overall how that trial goes.  
That's it for this extra-small post and I'll see you in the next time!
