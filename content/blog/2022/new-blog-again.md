Hey there everybody.

As you may guess by the title, I've done it again, I changed the blog engine, *once more*.

Reason for it is mainly simplicity. This year, I started making a small wiki which at some point moved to the main website and now I am doing the same for the blog.

It is also that Ghost has too much stuff and I'm too lazy to maintain it properly.

As a bonus, I added the archived blog posts from the old-old website.

Also, the new RSS feed URI is https://jae.fi/blog/index.xml now so don't forget to change it in your readers.

That's all for today's post and I'll see you next time!
