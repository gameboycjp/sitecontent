Greetings everyone, today, I'm gonna show you how you can make a crunchy peanut topping that can also be eaten as a snack.

You will need:

- 150g of sugar
- 150ml of water
- A pot
- 250g of salty peanuts (without spices)
- Cooking paper

First, put the sugar and water into the pot and put the head on medium.

When it becomes a syrup, add the peanuts.

Let the water evaporate. When it is evaporated, stir it until it has a brown-ish colour.

When it is good enough for you, put it on a sheet of cooking paper to cool down.

And voil√†, you have crunchy peanuts that can be used as a topping or eaten as a snack.

I'll see you next time!
