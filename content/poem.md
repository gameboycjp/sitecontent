We hide in the silence  
in the darkest corners  
waiting for the sweep of the searchlight to pass  
And on that hidden signal  
We strike  
Painting the world in the glow of a spectral supernova  
Illuminating the sky in gemstones and fireworks  
Until the we cross beyond the horizon  
and nothing remains of us...  
  
...but a trail of <span class="violet">ultraviolet</span> fading into the mist
