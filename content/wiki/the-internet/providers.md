# Providers

List of service providers I used at some point, noted and with comments.

| Name | Note | Comment |
| ---- | ---- | ------- |
| OVH Domains | 0/10 | Refuses to change legal names; no working DNSSEC |
| OVH Servers | 3/10 | Performance is OK but overpriced |
| Kimsufi | 8/10 | Really good servers for the price |
| Hetzner VPS | 9/10 | IPv6 ready/only; relatively cheap; good uptime; plenty of features available for free |
| Wasabi | 8/10 | Good prices; uptime OK |
| Cloudflare | -50/10 | Pieces of shit; Horrible both on the technical and human level |
| BunnyCDN | 8/10 | Works; IPv6 issues in some zones |
| Contabo | 5/10 | Reasonable prices; Hardware issues on number of machines from there; doesn't always advertises their maintenances on their status page |
| Dyjix | 2/10 | Clueless support; low quality machines, even for the price |
| Gandi | 10/10 | Best domain registrar; has almost all TLDs available; working DNSSEC |
| iFog | 10/10 | Helpful support; really good stuff |
| BuyVM | 6/10 | Good enough for shitposts; server had issues after three weeks running there |
| Reg.ru | 8/10 | Works good enough |
| 777.tf | 100/10 | The best <3 |
