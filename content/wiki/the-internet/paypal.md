# About PayPal

PayPal is an online payment processor and possibly the worse option there is for it. It was founded in the 2000's (or in the end of the 90's if you count their old stuff as PayPal) and they have well-known apps (mostly used in North America) like Venmo, Braintree or Honey. I hope I will not teach you anything about PayPal when I say it is the worse service ever. For instance, on TrustPilot global alone, it has a total note of 1.2/5 with over 22k reviews at the time of writing this. PayPal has a long history of never working, having enormous fees, locking people's money and straight up stealing. My personal experience with the service is no different as my account got disabled and then deleted for seemingly no reason.

For instance, on TrustPilot, you can read:

> My money stuck in paypal and i tried to call customer service they don’t have manners to talk to the clients they never resolved my problem really to much upset almost 4 months 230 euros never received back door use paypal they will block you without any reason paypal is a Fraud.

Or

> Would not recommend using PAYPAL AT ANY FREAKING COSTS!! $1000 OF MY MONEY IS LOCKED OUT CUSTOMER SERVICE WONT REPLY DONT USE

Or

> These people literally stole 2500$ from me. They flagged my account for suspicious activity. Held the funds for 180 days and then stole the money. This is the biggest dirt bag company in the world

As said earlier, my personal experience with the website is kinda the same, out of the blue, my account got disabled and deleted for no reason when I was just paying for game servers for a friend. I would now say 'good riddance' as this “service” is nothing much than a quick money grab for the scammers running the whole operation. If you are a business owner or just want to integrate a payment method to a project, at least go with Stripe, it works way better than PayPal.
