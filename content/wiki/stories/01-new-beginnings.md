# New Beginnings

---
Orbit of world [8830·3; P-2], datetime is 5594823;842-44, nearing the end of the first dominion war.
The Creators just gave the order to storm the planet. Almost instantly, the sky got darkened by a swarm of vessels.
On the surface, chaos was akin of the doomsday, the earth was scorched by high energy weapon blasts, people crying, not knowing where to flee.
All of the sudden, the sky dimmed, rapidly followed by a brightness never seen before. The sky was lit like it was burning.
All the inhabitants were unaware of the macabre reality: their sun was about to consume their planet, as well as their whole solar system.

The flagship of the fleet started to slowly advance in an imposing humming sound.
All of the sudden, the noise started to rise, like energy started condensing, until it reached a peak.
The space ahead of the vessel ripped in half in a blinding white light, creating an opening in which the vessel jumped in, completely disappearing; all the thousands of other, smaller, vessels then followed.
After the last one entered the aperture, it closed in an almost audible sudden closing of this rip in space.
The first dominion war was officially over, the Assembly prevailed once again.

World [0183·1; P-1], 1UA from CORE05.
A small group of humanoids was walking down the extensive cave system of the world.
This planet was so barren, so inhospitable that it was deemed foolish to even scan it for life signs, making it the perfect hideout place.
The small group was continuing deeper and deeper until they reached some kind of camp which, surprisingly, swarmed with life.
A liveable atmosphere was maintained through an elaborate system of shields and air filtering machines, making it possible to grow food and live there for extended periods of time.
You could see children running around, people cultivating but also the wounded being healed.
In a small building nearing the middle of the camp, you could see three people, all bent on a table, looking at a star chart.

"*Are you sure about this one?*" said the first, "*It's like the most secured place of the universe*".
"*It's now or never, we finally got access codes, we must not waste them*" replied the second.
The third then said, "*True, it's time to strike the heart of the beast and finish this once and for all*", they then continued "*Access codes are on rotation for a week each, we already wasted three days discussing whether we should do it or not. I am giving the green card, do whatever it takes.*"

Few minutes later, an alarm started blaring through the camp.
People that could still fight took their weapons and jumped onto a ship, all the others could only watch and hope for the best.

About thirty minutes later, the vessel started its flight towards CORE05, passing each security layer without too much hassle.
After an hour or two of flight, they could finally see it in all its glory, a supermassive Dyson Sphere, having swarms of smaller vessels orbiting it.
On the E-2 side of the sphere, you could observe some sort of hub, having multiple overtures as bright as the rip in space caused by the flagship vessel.
The warriors on the ship were more determined than ever, it was now or never.

The ship's system, outfitted by an advanced signature cloaking system, managed to have a clear landing pad which brought it in the core of the Sphere.
Although small in scale, the group ran out of the vessel as fast as they can, directly going to the nearest elevator.
The target control centre was around 75 floors up from their current position.
Upon entering, one of the members plugged a small device into the maintenance port of the elevator, thus marking it in maintenance mode and disallowing any further entrance.
The elevator then slowly rose, in a time that felt like years for those aboard.
As the control centre was getting closer, stress rose more and more, to a point where you could feel it in the room.
The final moment was near, what they had trained for for years.

When the doors opened, the small commando swarmed out, going directly for the shielded doors of the control centre.
One of them advanced faster, sticking two small packages on the doors, going away as soon as they were planted.
After a few seconds, a loud bang could be heard and within the dissipating smoke, the two doors, blast open.
An alarm started blaring, units started moving around and firing at our group that replied with their own weapons.
Their mission was now time limited as their members got decimated one by one.
They ran into the control centre, until they found the main console, where they planted another device.
"*It ends now*" shouted one of the soldiers, then activating the device.
Suddenly, all the units stopped moving; the alarm stopped as well.
Did they finally do it?

"*WE DID IT!*" shouted another soldier; the remaining ones started cheering, thinking their work was finally done.

Their joy was short lived, the units started moving again; only this time, they didn't fire.
Astonished, the soldiers held their fire, watching all those robots, going around like ants.
"*I can't believe this*" said one soldier, "*this is probably the worst case scenario*" replied another.

In trying to destroy their enemy, they in fact, released it from the control of their Creators that were now doomed, deprived of their soldiers.
Units started surrounding the soldiers that were now panicking.
"*I'm gonna shoot*" said one; another replied "*No, hold your fire*" but it was too late, the first shots were sent.
The small group got instantly swarmed, the shooter killed.
Immobilized on the ground, they could now take a cool at the units up close.

They looked like humanoid robots, with very sharp angles. Their heads were divided in half, like a mouth could open; they had a screen that displayed eyes or other data if needed.
Their whole bodies looked like it was made for combat, being more shielded than anything seen before; no wonder that the weapons used by the group were mostly ineffective.
Near the bottom, a large tail could be seen, here to resemble more the aspect of the Creators.

One of the units advanced and said in a robotic voice:
> We are Synths of the Imperium.
> You violated our space and tried to sabotage our infrastructure.
> Prepare to face the consequences.

Tetanised, the soldiers were transported onto a ship and their own ship towed in space.
After a bit of travel, they were in orbit of their hideout, from where the only other vessel was pulled.
The viewscreen was displaying the view of the two vessels, aimlessly floating in space, empty.
Suddenly, two shots, two hits and both ships destroyed; with it, their only chance to escape the planet.
One of the units declared:
> As a consequences for your actions, you shall remain on this world.
> Any attempts to escape will be stopped by force if necessary.
> You will be returned to the surface shortly.

All the remaining people were too stunned to speak as they were transported on the surface, only hearing the humming of the transporter.

*The Synths never really had a proper homeworld given the one of the Creators got destroyed long ago, while they weren't even created.
In place, they had an assortment of Dyson Spheres, spread around the centre of the galaxy, Sagittarius 1A\*.
CORE33 was one of those worlds but unlike the others, that were heavily protected and forbidden to non-Synths, this one is used as a trading hub and as some sort of storefront for what the Synth Imperium has the best to offer; from weapons to implants.
It attracted a lot of visitors fast in a young and growing galactic power.
Of course, nothing was easy, the Synths were hated throughout the quadrant, given their past as soldiers for one of the cruellest races that had ever lived in the universe.
Now free from the burden of war, remained to create or strengthen relation with other powers, big or small.
Some minor skirmishes still happened with races such as the Avalis given the past wars that happened between the two civilizations.*

*The Link is an intergalactic network that links all Synths.
It is an immaterial place of the Imperium where decisions are taken.
As security measure, Synth command is full decentralised so destroying a world wouldn't hurt the Imperium as much.*
