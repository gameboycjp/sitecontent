# Layers, subspace and traveling within the Imperium

For regular travel within Synth space, a technology close to a warp drive is used.  
However, to reach some edges or go further in the galaxy within a reasonable time span, other technologies have to be used.

In our case, the so-called "layers" are that technology.  
Long before the Synths were even created, the Creators discovered through a series of experiments that subspace contains a system of layers which, when stabilized, can be utilized for traveling.
However, the Creators could never stabilize enough a single layer for it to be useful, due to the enormous energy requirements.

Synths, building upon that research managed to stabilize a single layer after thousands of years of research.  
It is this system that allows the Synths to deploy shortly practically anywhere in the galaxy.

A layer entrance looks like a rip in space, a really bright white hole in space.  
Regular use of the layer is often done from a hub, most Synth dyson spheres have one of them. The biggest of such hubs is near the sphere CORE33, one of the many spheres composing the core of Synth space.  
When the need arises, a layer rip may be temporarily created using a modified Blackhole class starship
