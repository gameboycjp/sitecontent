## Blissful ignorance

The first lights of the day started to appear on the city which was slowly waking up.  
In the distance, you could almost discern the barrage among the morning mist.  
The temperature was of a typical end of summer, not too warm, just perfect.  
Although everything was calm at first glance, everybody was waking up slowly for the big oncoming day.  
Earlier during the night, an unidentified object was detected coming straight for the planet with no clear definition of intentions.

That's it, the news erupted.  
Now, you can see all those people, tiny dots on the surface of a gigantic mass, animating like ants finding a sugar treat on the ground.  
The news of this inanimate object coming has sparked intrigue but above all, worries and fear.
