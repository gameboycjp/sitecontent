> Note: I am aware putting this wiki here isn't practical for a lot of people as editing it is a bit exotic (requires knowledge of Git) for most users and finding it can be a bit hard.  
> This is only meant as a temporary measure until the official wiki is up (see issue [#1](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/1) for a status), so I think deploying and maintaining a full-on MediaWiki would be too much work as this works already pretty well.
