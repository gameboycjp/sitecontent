# Playlist

The music I listen to. Most links are to BandCamp. I highly recommend buying those tracks from BandCamp or directly from the artist to support them as they are for the most, small creators and BandCamp doesn't have any DRM on the tracks.

> Note: when "chiptune" is said, it is real chiptune from consoles or specific chips. "chiplike" is used when it is generated with modern hardware and has pretty much nothing to do with real chiptune.
