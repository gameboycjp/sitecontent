## The Fox and the Grapes

The Fox and the Grapes, Aesop

> A fox one found his way into a very fine garden.  
> I supposed he had missed the his road, for the favourite walk of the fox is into the poultry-yard, that he may pick up a chicken or two for his dinner.  
> Here there were a great many fine flowers; but the fox did not care for that.  
> Men are very fond of flowers, and so are bees and other insects; but birds and beasts think nothing about them; you never saw either smell at a rose.  
> There was also a great deal of fine fruit; and, as the fox was found of grapes, I dare say he was delighted to see the apples and pears and nectarines and peaches.  
> He walked up and down the garden, and was so pleased with every thing, that for the life of him he did not know what to chase.  
> At last, he came to a wall that was all covered with the finest grapes you ever saw.  
> They were full of juice almost ready to burst; the purple ones were turned black, and the green were so ripe, that they looked as if you could see through them.  
> Well, the wall wasn't exactly covered, the humans living around had gathered all the clusters that hung within their reach; but higher up, the vines were still full.  
> The moment the fox saw them, his choice was fixed: he resolved to make his dinner here without seeking any further.  
> The fox is a very little animal, though he is very nimble.  
> His ambition was greater than his strenght.  
> He jumped and jumped, you never saw such jumps in your life.  
> First, he could not jump high enough; but afterwards he mended his jumps, and he jumped as high as the clusters.  
> But not a single grape he could catch.  
> At last, he was quite tired and almost lame with the efforts he had made.  
> The fox was extremely mortified.  
> He looked up; there hung the grapes, but not one for him!  
> He determined then to carry off his disappoinment with a spirit.  
> "What a fool have I been!" said he.  
> "I can see now plain enough that the grapes are sour, and not fit to be eaten."
