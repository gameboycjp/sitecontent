# Netiquette

This page describes a personal version of the Netiquette (internet etiquette).

${toc}

## General

1. Don't spam
2. Don't troll
3. Don't feed the trolls
4. Remember that [your home country] is not the whole world - You will encounter people from around the world and all walks of life, be respectful towards them
5. Be careful with sarcasm - It might be hard to distinguish sarcasm from serious talk. It is considered good practice to add a `/s` at the end of your message in case of sarcasm

## Asking questions

1. Don't ask to ask, just ask the questions (this includes any "does anyone knows how to X")
2. Ask the whole channel/thread, not a single person - In a channel, many people can usually answer your question
3. Don't flood - Use a paste service like GitHub Gist to share logs or large amounts of text
4. Ask the question all at once
5. There are no stupid questions - Need help? Just ask for it, no matter if you think it's stupid. It's always better to ask than to stay ignorant
6. Be patient - People aren't 24/7 on their computers and might not answer quickly; this is especially true for volunteer-run projects
7. Details matter - If you want an issue to be solved, it is good practice to give as much information as possible
8. Avoid cross-posting - If you already posted your question somewhere, avoid cross-posting unless told to do so
