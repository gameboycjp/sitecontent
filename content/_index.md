# Welcome to my website!

## About me

Hey there, I'm Jae Lo Presti, I was born in the mountains of Savoy but I'm currently living in Helsinki (Finland). Currently looking to relocate in Germany (contact me if you have an opportunity around Berlin).

I mainly do code and sysadmin but i also like to meddle in networking as I operate <span class="in">[AS211696](/pages/as211696)</span>, and, on my free time, I operate a bunch of public services.

I also happen to write a bunch of software that you can find on [SourceHut](/redir/srht).

My contact options are:

Matrix will likely get you the fastest response tho I read and respond to every single query (as long as they're not spam). Use email in last resort if you really don't have anything else as it's not the best protocol out there (the email server used by <span class="il">777.tf</span> is hosted by myself so nobody can snoop on it).
