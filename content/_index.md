# Welcome to my website!

## About me

Hey there, I'm Jae Lo Presti (AKA J4), I was born in the mountains of Savoy but I'm currently living in Helsinki (Finland).  

I mainly do code, sysadmin and networking (used to operate AS211696).

On my free time, I create content on Resonite as a mentor, including maps, systems, objects and tutorials. I also happen to make 3D art.  
You can check out:
- [My maps](/pages/maps)
- [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@j4l/)
- [My renders & art](/pages/renders)

I also happen to write a bunch of software that you can find on [SourceHut](/redir/srht).
