# Welcome to my website!

## About me

Hey there, I'm Jae Lo Presti (AKA J4), I was born in the mountains of Savoy but I'm currently living in Helsinki (Finland).  

I mainly do code and sysadmin but i also like to meddle in networking as I operate <span class="in">[AS211696](/pages/as211696)</span>, and, on my free time, I make software that I need.

I also happen to write a bunch of software that you can find on [SourceHut](/redir/srht).

Matrix will likely get you the fastest response tho I read and respond to every single query (as long as they're not spam).
